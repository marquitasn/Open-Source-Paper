In reference to software, the term “Open Source” represents the idea that original source code is freely available to all individuals, including any utilization that permits the modification and redistribution of the program. The Copy Left movement is an approach that determines a program and any future version of it to be free, allowing for innovative collaboration between groups of people to improve its efficiency. Richard Stallman is an American programmer and prominent activist for the free software movement. Stallman is specifically known for his leadership and influence concerning the Free Software Foundation, and impacts on Linus Torvalds that led to the eventual ubiquity of the Linux kernel.

Stallman’s fundamental stance on the free software debate is that the resource of “free software is the first battle in the liberation of cyberspace.” Stallman feels that with the way computers and programs are currently set up, everyday users assume that their computer and machines are obeying their orders. He goes on to explain that in reality, computers are following the instructions previously laid out by large companies, who let computers only execute instructions to the extent that corporations authorize. Stallman states that there are two possibilities when it comes to software, “either the users control the program, or the program controls the users.” There are four essential freedoms that Stallman reviews, these include the freedoms of individual and collective control through changes and redistribution of a program. Without even just one of the four freedoms, Stallman suggests that this situation causes users to lose control of the program, and the developer’s program has become an “instrument of unjust power.” 

The software owners of some reputable companies such as Microsoft have the ability to abuse users, as well as take advantage of them by purposely inserting adverse functions into user software to acquire more money. In 1983, Richard Stallman disclosed that he would release a software operating system that was completely free called GNU. In 1992, all the aspects of the system were complete, except for a kernel. Linus Torvalds helped achieve this by adding the Linux kernel to GNU, making the system completely free to run on a PC. Several distributions tried to imitate the GNU plus Linux system, but few did so with the intention of maintaining its completely free aspect. Some of these other systems are majority free, with certain programs that require payment for users to access all their capabilities. Stallman clarifies that said distributions of his original system are not concerned with the freedom of users, but rather with monetary benefits and convenience. 

Stallman’s argument highlights that in order to gain software freedom, users must make some sacrifices or take some inconvenient avenues when working with different software. Servers may send programs that are not free to a user’s computer, but the user can install a program that keeps out non-free software. If a vast collection of users avoid software that is not free, this can change the dynamic of how free software is perceived and encourage user freedom. Certain individuals claim that software should be completely free, other people feel that it should be partially free but not completely free, because of business and security concerns they may have. There are also groups of people who assert that all software should not be free. Leaving aside subjective opinions, it is crucial for individuals on all sides of the free software debate to understand the programs themselves and reflect on the ethical reasoning why they are in support of or opposed to user freedom.
